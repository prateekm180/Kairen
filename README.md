# Kairen — Evolution of a Python Virtual Assistant

Kairen is a personal AI assistant project developed across multiple years, platforms, and skill levels.
This repository documents the complete evolution of Kairen — from a simple Android-based assistant written during Class 12, to a full-fledged AI assistant with GUI and LLM integration built in college.

This is not just code — it’s a learning timeline.

# Project Timeline Overview

Year	Version	Platform	Description
2021	Kairen Prototype	Android (QPython3L)	First AI assistant experiment during Class 12
2022	Kairen Windows	Windows OS	Cross-platform port with cleaner logic
2024	Kairen Plus	Windows OS	Full AI assistant with GUI & LLM integration
